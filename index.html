      <h2>Saxophones were first designed in 1840 by Adolphe Sax, a Belgian instrument maker. They were made with the bass clarinet in mind, but tweaking the acoustics and choosing easier fingering patterns. All saxophones are tuned to B♭ or E♭, depending on which model, but the first prototypes were tuned to F and C.</h3>
